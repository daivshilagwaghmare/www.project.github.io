<p style="color:red" ><b>"AMERICAN HISTORY" IS A COMING-OF-AGE TALE SET IN THE EARLY 1960S, 

WHEN RACISM AND SEGREGATION WERE STILL IN FULL BLOOM. THE STORY'S FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD 
PROTAGONIST, ELENA, IS A PUERTO RICAN IMMIGRANT LIVING WITH HER FAMILY IN PATERSON, NEW  
JERSEY, WHEN PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY IS ASSASSINATED. DESPITE THIS TRAGIC EVENT, ELENA IS 
FOCUSED ON EUGENE, HER NEW NEIGHBOR AND THE OBJECT OF HER DAYDREAMS. WHEN ELENA VISITS 
EUGENE THAT EVENING, SHE EXPERIENCES HER OWN PERSONAL TRAGEDY IN THE FORM OF PREJUDICE.</p>



<p  style="font-family:Cambria Math">Skinny Bones is a teenage Puerto Rican girl struggling to adapt to life in a multifamily apartment building in 
Paterson, New Jersey. She lives in a former Jewish neighborhood that is now inhabited mostly by Puerto Ricans 
and African Americans. As a loner, Skinny Bones is attracted to marginalized individuals like herself. She finds her 
soulmate in Eugene, a shy teenager who has recently come from south Georgia. Because of his marked southern 
accent he is soon dubbed “the Hick,” and he becomes the school’s newest object of ridicule, joining Skinny Bones 
as an outcast. Skinny Bones falls in love with Eugene, and they soon become inseparable, despite their cultural differences.
 Eugene, a bright student, tutors Skinny Bones in several subjects. Although Skinny Bones is a good student, she is not 
admitted to advanced courses because English is not her first language.</p>
