<h4>History of Delhi </h4>



<p style="font-family:Cambria Math">One of the most fascinating aspects of Delhi is the "visibility" of its historic past. 
Were it not for the demands of urbanization, large portions of the city could well be 
earmarked as archaeological parks. This is because the rulers of successive dynasties 
between the 13th and the 17th centuries established seven cities in different parts of Delhi. 
A chronological review of these cities fortunately also serves as a suitable itinerary for tourists 
and highlights the important monuments amongst the 1300 officially listed.</p>






<p style="font-family:Cambria Math">Delhi's history goes much further back in time than the 13th century. In 1955, 
excavations at the Purana Qila revealed that the site was inhabited 3000 years ago. 
Ware pottery known as Painted Gray Ware and dated to 1000 BC confirmed this 
being yet another site associated with the epic Mahabharata. The excavations also 
cut through houses and streets of the Sultanate, Rajput, post-Gupta, Gupta, 
Saka-Kushan and Sunga periods, reaching down to the Mauryan era (300 BC), 
thus revealing almost continuous habitaion. The association of Emperor Ashoka 
(273-36 BC) with Delhi has come to light with the discovery of a Minor Rock Edict 
in the locality known as Srinivaspuri.</p>
