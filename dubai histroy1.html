<h4>History of Dubai </h4>





<p style="font-family:Cambria Math">Dubai is one of the most popular destinations in the world for holidays and tours, and there     
are millions of travellers visiting the city every year. Shopping festivals, culinary delights and loads 
of adventure – your Dubai vacation will be all this and more! Whether you are visiting with family   
or friends, a vacation in Dubai will make you want to travel here again. Stunning man-made wonders   
 like Palm Jumeirah and Burj Khalifa are the pride of Dubai. The view from atop Burj Khalifa                    
observation deck is equally stunning, with towering buildings looking small in comparison with          
the world’s tallest building. Sightseeing in Dubai is incomplete without a dinner cruise where          
 you can enjoy the best of Middle Eastern flavours and panoramic night views. Nightlife is
 another big attraction in Dubai. With a variety of restaurants, hookah bars, lounges and clubs,    
a night out in the town can be an exciting one. Shopping is the name of the game in Dubai. 
Head to the famous Gold Souk, Dubai Mall or Mall of the Emirates for great deals and gifts           
for loved ones. Adventure buffs can try activities like hot-air ballooning, skydiving, skiing, 
zorbing, scuba diving, and even desert safari in sand dunes.</p>
