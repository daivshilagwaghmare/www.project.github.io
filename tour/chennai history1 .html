<h4>History of Chennai </h4>














<body>

<p style="font-family:Cambria Math">Tamil Nadu was ruled by three major dynasties-the Cholas in the east, 
the Pandyas in the central area and Cheras in the west. This was during the 
Sangam Age-the classical period of Tamil literature-that continued for some 
300 years after the birth of Christ. The Pallava dynasty was influential particularly
 in the 7th and 8th centuries, testimonies to which are the monuments at Mamallapuram. 
In the 13th century, with threats of Muslim invasions from the north, the southern Hindu 
dynasties combined and the empire of Vijayanagar, which covered all of South India, 
was firmly established. However, by the 17th century, due to the disintegration of the 
Vijayanagar Empire, various small rulers like the Nayaks ruled southern India.</p>
