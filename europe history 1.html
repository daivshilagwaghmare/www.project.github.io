<h4> <em>History oF Europe</em></h4>

<p  style="font-family:Cambria Math">The history of Europe covers the peoples inhabiting Europe from prehistory to the present.
During the Neolithic era (starting at c. 7000 BC.) and the time of the Indo-European migrations (starting at c. 4000 BC.) 
Europe saw massive migrations from east and southeast which also brought agriculture, new technologies, and the Indo-European languages, 
primarily through the areas of the Balkan peninsula and the Black sea region.</p>

<p  style="font-family:Cambria Math">The period known as classical antiquity began with the emergence of the city-states of Ancient Greece. After ultimately 
checking the Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars in the 5th century BC, Greek influence reached its 
zenith under the expansive empire of Alexander the Great, spreading throughout Asia, Africa, and other parts of Europe. 
The Thracians and their kingdoms and culture were long present in Southeast Europe. The Roman Empire came to dominate 
the entire Mediterranean basin. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the Western and Eastern empires. During the 
4th and 5th centuries, the Germanic peoples of Northern Europe, pressed by the Huns, grew in strength and lead repeated attacks 
that resulted in the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. The Western empire's collapse in AD 476 traditionally marks the end of the 
classical period and the start of the Middle Ages.</p>
