<h4> <em>History oF Singapore </em></h4>

<p  style="font-family:Cambria Math">The British, who were extending their dominion in India, and whose trade with China in the second half of the 18th 
century was expanding, saw the need for a port of call in this region to refit, revitalise and protect their merchant fleet,
 as well as to forestall any advance by the Dutch in the East Indies. As a result, they established trading posts in Penang 
(1786) and Singapore (1819), and captured Malacca from the Dutch (1795).</p>


<h4>The Straits Settlements</h4>
<p  style="font-family:Cambria Math">Singapore, together with Malacca and Penang, the two British settlements in the Malay Peninsula, became the 
Straits Settlements in 1826, under the control of British India. By 1832, Singapore had become the centre of government
 for the three areas. On 1 April 1867, the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony under the jurisdiction of the Colonial Office in London.

<h4>Towards Self-Government</h4>
<p  style="font-family:Cambria Math">The British forces returned in September 1945 and Singapore came under the British Military Administration. 
When the period of military administration ended in March 1946, the Straits Settlements was dissolved. On 1 April 1946, 
Singapore became a Crown Colony. Penang and Malacca became part of the Malayan Union in 1946, and later the Federation 
of Malaya in 1948.</p>
<p  style="font-family:Cambria Math">Postwar Singapore was a contrast to the prewar country of transient immigrants. The people, especially the merchant class,
 clamored for a say in the government. Constitutional powers were initially vested in the Governor who had an advisory council 
of officials and nominated non-officials. This evolved into the separate Executive and Legislative Councils in July 1947. The Governor 
retained firm control over the colony but there was provision for the election of six members to the Legislative Council by popular 
vote. Hence, Singapore's first election was held on 20 March 1948.</p>
