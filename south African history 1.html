<h4><em>South Africa</em></h4>

<body>
<p  style="font-family:Cambria Math">South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa,
is the southernmost sovereign state in Africa. South Africa is a multiethnic society 
encompassing a wide variety of cultures, languages, and religions. Its pluralistic makeup 
is reflected in the constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, which is among the
 highest number of any country in the world.South Africa has a generally temperate climate, 
due in part to being surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, by its 
location in the climatically milder Southern Hemisphere and due to the average elevation 
rising steadily towards the north (towards the equator) and further inland.</p>
